This is a socket.IO client written in python, it can be used to send commands and data to a socket.IO server.

socket.IO protocol: https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io-spec

Example to use it:
sio = socketio.socketio('127.0.0.1' 1234) #You also can use debug = True and secure = True
sio.connect() #Handshaking the server and connecting to it + starting the extra threads
sio.sendEvent({'name': 'Test', 'args' : 'Hello world'}) #sending an event
event = sio.receiveEvent() # returns a dictonary with a name and a args key
sio.heartbeat() #Dont use this, it automatically sends heartbeats to the server with a timeout given by the server
sio.disconnect() #Disconnecting from the server and stopping the server threads !!If you don't disconnect your programm will not stop running...

TODO:
Better disconnecting, probably just atexit.register(disconnect)
